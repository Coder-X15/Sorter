Hello! As an attempt to make a prime number sieve using Python, I have started a new repository here... 
At this moment of development, I am only uploading a module for calculating gcd and lcm.
Please do tell me if you find any bug here... :)
My gratitude goes to:
------------
Wikipedia - for getting me an article on prime number sieves
The inventors of the Sieve of Atkin
Well, you all who download this or at least star this... :)
